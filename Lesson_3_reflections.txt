When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
To cooperate with other developers

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay 
up-to-date with your remote repository?
I would rather kept process under the control.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Clone and forks are just copies made in remote and local repositories respectively. Branches though would
 be used to control or changes made by different developers or experimental changes.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
This is the most effective way to control changes and cooperate with other developers.
